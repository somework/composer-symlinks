Usage
-----

### 1. Define symlinks

Create the symlinks definition adding a `somework/composer-symlinks` section inside the `extra` section of the composer.json file.

Set `skip-missing-target` to true if we should not throw exception if target path doesn't exists  
Set `absolute-path` to true if you want to create realpath symlinks  
Set `throw-exception` to false if you dont want to break creating on some error while check symlinks  
Set `force-create` to force unlink link if something already exists on link path    

You can set personal configs for any symlink.  
For personal configs `link` must be defined  

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "somework/composer-symlinks": {
            "symlinks": {
                "common/upload": "web/upload",
                "common/static/dest": {
                    "link": "web/dest",
                    "skip-missing-target": false,
                    "absolute-path": true,
                    "throw-exception": false
                },
                "common/web": [
                    "web1",
                    "web2",

                        "web3/local"
                    ]
